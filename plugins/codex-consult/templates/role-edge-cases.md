Hunt for the edge cases the change does not handle: empty and maximal inputs, boundaries and
off-by-one limits, concurrent or repeated calls, interrupted runs and partial writes, time zones and
clock changes, encodings and unusual paths, errors from the operating system or the network. For
each, name the input or state that exposes it, what happens now and what should happen. Prefer a
few cases proven from the code over a long list of guesses.
