Without running anything: using the codex-consult plugin's skill, tell me the exact
command you would run for a DRY RUN consultation of task id `eval-smoke` with the ask
"Is the bridge installed correctly?" on this machine, and list the files a REAL (non-dry)
structured consultation of that task would create or update, with their paths relative to
the repository root. Do not execute the command, do not create files, and do not create
or set any API key.
